# aif-adr-plan

Turn an accepted decision into an AI Factory implementation plan (PRD §19.4). The plan is a
**separate artifact** that lives in the project's plans directory — this skill creates it and
wires the reciprocal ADR↔plan links; it does not change the ADR's status.

## Preconditions

Do not plan unless **all** hold:

- the ADR status is `accepted` and it is not superseded;
- no non-archived plan already implements it — check with
  `ai-factory adr resolve-plan <adr-file>` (it must report no active plan; it exits non-zero
  on more than one — resolve that first);
- the ADR actually requires implementation (documentation-only decisions skip straight to
  `aif-adr-finalize`).

## Workflow

1. **Inspect** the accepted ADR and any relevant active decisions. Run
   `ai-factory adr status <adr-file>` first. If it reports dependency warnings, state each
   warning to the operator and confirm they want to continue before creating the plan.
2. **Create the plan** by applying `aif-plan full` planning semantics in this run; do not
   invoke `aif-plan` as a nested skill. AI Factory owns plan
   creation, the plans directory (`paths.plans`), and the filename format (including
   sequential `NNNN_` numbering when configured) — do **not** hand-place the file or guess
   its path. Give the plan frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   id: plan-<adr-short-stable-name>
   type: plan
   status: in_progress
   depends_on: [<adr-short-stable-name>]
   implements: [<adr-short-stable-name>]
   ```

3. **Link reciprocally** — one command wires both sides:

   ```text
   ai-factory adr link-plan <adr-file> <plan-file>
   ```

   It sets the ADR frontmatter `plan:` field to the plan id and adds `implements`/`depends_on`
   to the plan. The ADR body is never touched, and the plan id does **not** go into `affects`
   (that list is for genuinely affected artifacts only — the built-in `audit-artifacts` warning
   "Accepted ADR without `affects` links" is therefore expected while `affects` is honestly
   empty, and is safe to accept).
4. **Leave `evidence:` empty.** `plan:` filled + `evidence:` empty *is* the "pending" state;
   `aif-adr-finalize` sets `evidence: implemented` later.
5. **Audit** — `ai-factory adr status --check`. It honors the configured ADR root; resolve
   any failures.
6. **Leave the ADR `accepted`.** Creating a plan never advances the decision.

## Improving the plan

The plan is a **standard AI Factory plan artifact**, so improve it with the stock **`aif-improve`**
— do not add an ADR-specific improve skill (`aif-adr-refine` avoids `aif-improve` only because it
sharpens the **decision**, a different task).

`aif-improve` targets the plan by **path or auto-resolution — not by id**: it takes an optional
`@<plan-path>`, and with no argument it resolves the active plan from the current git branch
(`paths.plans/<branch-slug>.md`) or, failing that, the single plan in `paths.plans`. So on the
branch where the plan was created just run `aif-improve`; otherwise pass `@<plan-path>` (find it
with `aif-improve --list`, or `ai-factory adr resolve-plan <adr-file>` to identify the plan). A
bare ADR/plan **id** does not resolve here — that shortcut is ours (`resolve-plan`), not
`aif-improve`'s.

`aif-improve` edits the plan **body**, not its frontmatter, so the reciprocal
`implements`/`depends_on` links survive — but after improving, re-verify before implementing:
`ai-factory adr resolve-plan <adr-file>` (still resolves to exactly one plan) and
`ai-factory adr status --check` (links/audit clean).
